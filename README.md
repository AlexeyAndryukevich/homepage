# Homepage

Hello world! :earth_asia:

Here I develop my very own personal website. Basically this is a résumé, beautiful:blush: and technological:sunglasses: résumé ;)

And with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) I can kill two birds with one stone, not only do development with handy tools but also to host here my site.



_For more information see [Wiki](https://github.com/AlexeyAndryukevich/homepage/wiki)_.

Thanks for visiting my repo!
